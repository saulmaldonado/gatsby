>One of Deep Ellum's better bars by any measure, Armoury D.E. is especially beloved for its food. Owner Peter Novotny works with chef Abram Vargas to make his Hungarian heritage clear on the menu — >it's actually the most Hungarian menu in the region — with hearty goulash, an array of paprika-spiced sausages and hearty sandwiches. Even the S&M salad (that's strawberry and mushrooms) has a >die-hard club of fans. Try the charcuterie board.
